# Comment on Comet Ice

Check out this [XKCD What If](https://what-if.xkcd.com/162/).

1. Why settle with a water comet? Get an Oxygen comet.
    -   Let's assume we can make comets to our liking. Make a pure Oxygen comet.
        -   Pros:
            1.  Lower temps
            2.  More O_2/O_3
                -   Non-Greenhouse
2. Heating of the comet (and corresponding heating of the atmosphere) is related to the drag coefficient of the comet while falling.
    -   Since we are designing the comet anyway
        1.  Pencil/Spear shaped comet
            -   Drop it head-first into an ocean
        2.  Drag increases with surface area, whereas heat capacity increases with volume
            -   Maximise comet size under other constraints [1]
            -   More cooling, less heating
